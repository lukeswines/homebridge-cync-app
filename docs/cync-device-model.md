## **Cync Device and Room Model**

This document defines the normalized structures used to represent Cync homes, rooms, devices, controllers, and capabilities. These definitions are derived from the behavior of the upstream Home Assistant integration.

---

## **1. Data Model Overview**

The Cync platform divides user resources into:

* **Homes**
* **Rooms (Groups)**
* **Devices (Switches, Plugs, Bulbs, Fan Switches, Motion/Ambient Sensors)**
* **Controllers (Wi-Fi switches controlling BLE mesh groups)**

The device model is primarily determined by cloud configuration, while device state is handled through the TCP protocol.

---

## **2. Home Structure**

```
CyncHome {
  id: string
  name: string
  controllers: number[]        // switch_id values
  homeDevices: { [meshIndex: number]: deviceId }
}
```

### **Properties**

* A home exists only if it contains at least one valid controller.
* Controller devices act as gateways for mesh devices over the TCP protocol.

---

## **3. Room Structure**

```
CyncRoom {
  roomId: string               // "{homeId}-{groupId}"
  name: string
  homeId: string
  meshId: number               // group ID
  roomController: string       // associated controller switch_id
  switches: string[]           // device IDs belonging to this room
  isSubgroup: boolean
  subgroups: string[]          // child rooms
  parentRoom?: string          // resolved later
}
```

### **Notes**

* Subgroups are validated as part of configuration assembly.
* Some room types represent multi-element groupings.

---

## **4. Device Structure**

```
CyncDevice {
  id: string
  name: string
  homeId: string
  roomId?: string
  roomName?: string
  meshId: number
  switchId: string             // controller association or "0"
  capabilities: CyncCapabilities
}
```

### **Behavior**

* Devices may represent plugs, bulbs, switches, fan switches, or sensors.
* Capabilities determine which HomeKit services will be exposed.

---

## **5. Capability Flags**

```
CyncCapabilities {
  onOff: boolean
  brightness: boolean
  colorTemp: boolean
  rgb: boolean

  motion: boolean
  ambientLight: boolean

  wifiControl: boolean         // device is a controller
  plug: boolean                // device is a smart plug
  fan: boolean                 // device is a fan switch

  multiElement?: number        // number of segments in multi-gang switches
}
```

These flags originate from a fixed mapping inside the upstream integration and are chosen based on the device’s reported type.

---

## **6. Controller Relationships**

Controllers bridge Wi-Fi → Cync mesh.

* Devices with `wifiControl == true` identify themselves as controllers.
* `switchID_to_homeID` maps each controller to an owning home.
* Devices without `switchId` or with `"0"` are assumed to be mesh-only nodes and must route commands through their associated controller.

---

## **7. Summary**

The model above defines the minimal structured representation required to:

* Construct Homebridge accessories.
* Route state updates.
* Build correct command frames (requires `switchId`, `meshId`).
* Group devices into rooms.
* Build user-facing metadata for configuration.
